# @pixid/canvas

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Ship minified builds.

  The 0.1.0 tarballs for `@pixid/core`, `@pixid/svg`, `@pixid/png`,
  `@pixid/canvas`, and `@pixid/react` were published before `minify: true` was
  added to the tsup configs, so their `dist` output shipped unminified. This
  release republishes every package with minified ESM, CJS, and IIFE bundles. No
  API changes.

- Updated dependencies
  - @pixid/core@0.1.1
